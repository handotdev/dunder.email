            What is the history of Dunder Mifflin? Dunder Mifflin was founded by
            Robert Dunder and Robert Mifflin, who met while on a Dartmouth
            College tour. The college buddies became fast friends and went into
            business together in 1949. Before the company sold paper, Dunder
            Mifflin profited off of selling parts for construction. Since then,
            the company has found its niche in the paper and printer industry.
